# **E-commerce Recommendation System - Proof of Concept (PoC)**

## **üìñ Overview**
This repository contains the **proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation** for an **e-commerce recommendation system** that provides personalized product recommendations based on user interactions and product similarities. The system utilizes **three key data structures**:

1. **UserRegistry** (Hash Table) - Manages user profiles and preferences.  
2. **InteractionStore** (Matrix Representation) - Tracks user-product interactions.  
3. **ProductMatcher** (KD-Tree) - Finds similar products based on feature vectors.  

This PoC serves as a **foundation** for building a scalable recommendation system and will be further optimized in later phases.
